      <p>I grew up naturally talented at math and science. Like, <em>annoying Hermione Granger</em> talented. The kind of talent that makes teachers say things like, “You're gonna go far, kid.” and classmates say “Can I cheat off of your test?” But here’s the thing about talent: people act like those who have it are some kind of prodigy. But all it really means is that you learn faster than average. That’s it. Talent’s the fast-pass line to understanding, not the destination itself. You don’t necessarily need it to be great at something. For that, you just need practice and persistence.</p>

      <p>For some perspective, during my last year at Estero High, I was literally setting the curve in my classes. Sorry to everyone who remembers Mr. Stewart’s 2008 physics final—yeah, the one where I accidentally broke the curve. I think I got a 120%. The dude said the top score would count as 100%, but I couldn’t stop there, no. Apparently my brain needed the dopamine hit of nailing <em>every single</em> extra credit question. Why? No clue. Probably the same reason I alphabetize my spice rack and then immediately forget where I put the Adobo.</p>

      <p>Still, even while I breezed through STEM classes, I had this itch to just <em>make</em> things. Draw. Play guitar. Build model kits. DIY anything that could be taken apart and barely put back together again. That creative bugger was always trying to get out. But I was talented at STEM, so I convinced myself to focus my energy there and force my creativity to be no more than just a hobby.</p>

      <p>As graduation approached and I started applying to the many universities of Florida, my dream wasn’t to be some uber-detail-oriented engineer half-asleep and face-first in a spreadsheet. I wanted to be a <em>3D animator</em>. I thought maybe, just maybe, I’d help make a new Star Wars movie someday. Wouldn’t that be amazing?! However, when I got accepted into the University of Florida—a top-ten public university (🔸🔷Go Gators🔶🔹)—I found out they didn’t even have a proper animation program. I’d have to major in computer science and just “figure it out from there.” That felt like a strike against the dream. Then I told myself, “Well, they’re probably done making Star Wars movies, anyway. They <em>did</em> just finish the last move, Episode III.” Oh, sweet summer child. I understood that to be strike two. And then, for reasons still unknown to modern science, I gave myself strike three. Just—<em>poof</em>—no hope left. Creative dream over.</p>

      <p>So I did what seemed logical at the time: I opened a spreadsheet. My dad and I built a table of every major offered at UF and ranked them by average starting salary, difficulty, and credit hours. Chemical Engineering was the major that came out on top. Prerequisite: be talented at chemistry and even more talented at math. Check and check. Challenge accepted. Never mind that I had <em>no idea</em> what an engineer actually did. I thought I’d find out eventually (spoiler alert: it took me until my internship in the summer of 2012 to actually learn that aspect.) But I stuck with it. Graduated with honors. Built a career. Figured out how to find pride in what I do.</p>

      <p>Despite all that—something clicked when I celebrated my 33rd birthday in Minnesota with my family and late grandmother. Like an old engine that coughed and finally turned over after years of ignoring the check-engine light. I realized it’s <em>not too late</em> to start the thing my heart just wouldn’t shut up about. I had stories to tell and a legacy I wanted to leave behind. Truths to share that were bigger than myself. So I made the commitment to learn to write, and eventually write a novel.</p>

      <p>At first I thought, “thirty-three feels a little old to start writing a debut novel.” It’s the kind of age where you think to yourself, "If I was good at this, I'd have done it by now. Don’t all of the famous artists out there hit their stride before they even turn twenty-two?" But during that week in Minnesota, I decided to forget about talent and take a shot at seeing what practice and persistence—and most importantly, <em>passion</em>—could get me. I’m still an engineer by trade, but getting my stories out there has become my calling.</p>

      <p>So here I am, an engineer turned aspiring author, writing my first novel.</p>

      <p>Maybe this post is just my way of saying: if there’s something calling you, something you’ve convinced yourself it’s too late for… it’s not. You’re not too late.</p>

      <p><strong>It's only ever too late if you stop believing you can begin.</strong></p>
