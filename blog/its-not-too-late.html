      <p>I grew up naturally talented at math and science. Like, <em>Hermione Granger</em> talented. The kind of talent that makes teachers say things like, “You're gonna go far, kid.” But here’s the thing about talent: people act like those who have it are some kind of prodigy. But all it really means is that you learn faster than average. That’s it. Talent’s the fast-pass line to understanding, not the destination itself. You don’t necessarily need it to be great at something. For that, you just need practice and persistence.</p>

      <p>Still, even while I was solving algebraic equations in grade school, I had this itch to <em>make</em> things. Draw. Play guitar. Build model kits. DIY anything that could be taken apart and barely put back together again. That creative bugger was always trying to get out, but I was talented at STEM, so I funneled my energy there and let creativity stay a hobby.</p>

      <p>When I graduated from Estero High, I was literally setting the curve in my classes. Sorry to everyone who remembers Mr. Stewart’s 2008 physics final—yeah, the one where I accidentally broke the scale. I think I got a 120%. The dude said the top score would count as 100%. I could’ve stopped there. But no—apparently my brain needed the dopamine hit of nailing <em>every</em> extra credit question. Why? No clue. Probably the same reason I alphabetize my spice rack and then immediately forget where I put the Adobo.</p>

      <p>But at the time, my dream wasn’t to be some uber-detail-oriented engineer half-asleep face-first in a spreadsheet. I wanted to be a <em>3D animator</em>. I thought maybe, just maybe, I’d help make a new Star Wars movie someday. When I got into the University of Florida—a top-ten public university (🔸🔷Go Gators🔶🔹)—I found out they didn’t even have a proper animation program. I’d have to major in computer science and just “figure it out.” That felt like a strike against the dream. Then I told myself, “Well, they’re probably done making Star Wars movies anyway.” Oh, sweet summer child. That was strike two. And then, for reasons still unknown to modern science, I gave myself strike three. Just—<em>poof</em>—no hope left. Creative dream over.</p>

      <p>So I did what seemed logical at the time: I opened a spreadsheet. My dad and I built a table of every major UF offered. We ranked them by average starting salary, difficulty, and credit hours. Chemical Engineering came out on top. Prerequisite: be talented at chemistry and even more talented at math. Check and check. Challenge accepted. Never mind that I had <em>no idea</em> what an engineer actually did. I figured I’d find out eventually. (Spoiler: it took me until my internship in 2012 to actually figure that out.) But I stuck with it. Graduated with honors. Built a career. Figured out how to find pride in what I do.</p>

      <p>Despite all that—something clicked on my 33rd birthday. Like an old engine that coughed and finally turned over after years of ignoring the check-engine light. I realized it’s <em>not too late</em> to start the thing your heart won’t shut up about. I had a story to tell.</p>

      <p>Thirty-three feels old to start writing a debut novel. It’s the kind of age where you think to yourself, "If I was good at this, I'd have done it by now. All of the famous artists out there hit their stride before they even turned twenty-two." But that day, I decided to forget talent and take a shot at seeing what practice and persistence—and most importantly, <em>passion</em>—could get me. I’m still an engineer by trade, but getting my story out there has become my calling.</p>

      <p>So here I am — an engineer turned aspiring author — writing my first novel.</p>

      <p>Maybe this post is just my way of saying: if there’s something calling you, something you’ve convinced yourself it’s too late for… it’s not. You’re not too late.</p>

      <p><strong>It's only ever too late if you stop believing you can begin.</strong></p>
