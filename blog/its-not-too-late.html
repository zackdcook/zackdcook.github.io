      <h1>It’s Not Too Late to Start</h1>
      <div class="date">October 16, 2025</div>

      <p>I grew up being good at math and science. The kind of good that makes teachers say things like, “You’ve got real talent.”</p>

      <p>But here’s the thing about talent — it just means you learn faster. It doesn’t mean you love it more. It doesn’t mean it fills you up.</p>

      <p>Ever since I can remember, I’ve had this itch to create — to draw, play the guitar, build model kits, make jewelry, film goofy videos, write stories, DM campaigns… anything that let me make something from nothing. But I let that itch fester in the background while I focused on what I thought were the “right” things — the things that were supposed to make me successful.</p>

      <p>Back in my final year at Estero High School (oh-eight, ain’t it great?), I literally set the curve in Mr. Mitchell’s physics class — somewhere around 125%. (Sorry, everyone — I love you!) I aced every question, even the extra credit. Talent. Sure. But my dream wasn’t to be a scientist. I wanted to be a 3D animator — maybe even work on a new Star Wars movie someday.</p>

      <p>But when I got into the University of Florida, I learned they didn’t have an animation program yet. Strike one.<br>
      Then I told myself, “Well, they’re probably done making Star Wars movies anyway, now that Episode III is out.” Oh, sweet summer child. Strike two.<br>
      And then I gave myself strike three — for no real reason at all — and benched my dream.</p>

      <p>So I did what seemed logical. I sat down with my dad, made a spreadsheet of every major at UF, and sorted by three columns: average starting salary, difficulty, and credit hours. Chemical Engineering came out on top for every single metric. It checked every rational box.<br>
      Prerequisites: be good at chemistry and even better at math. Check and check. Let’s do it.</p>

      <p>I didn’t even know what an engineer did for work, but it seemed like a challenge — and I can never resist a challenge. (I honestly didn’t figure out what a day in the life of an engineer looked like until my summer internship in 2012.)</p>

      <p>But I stuck with Chemical Engineering. Even graduated with honors. And to be fair, it’s brought me plenty of fulfillment over the years — just not the kind that makes your soul come alive.</p>

      <p>Then something shifted on my 33rd birthday.</p>

      <p>It hit me that it’s not too late.<br>
      Not too late to start.<br>
      Not too late to follow that tug on your soul.<br>
      Not too late to tell the stories you’ve kept bottled up because “life got in the way.”</p>

      <p>So here I am — an engineer turned aspiring author — writing my first novel.</p>

      <p>And maybe this post is just my way of saying: if there’s something calling you, something you’ve convinced yourself it’s too late for… it’s not. You’re not.</p>

      <p><strong>The only real deadline is the one where you stop believing you can begin.</strong></p>

      <p><em>(Next post: what actually happened when I finally started writing.)</em></p>
