    <h1>About Zack D. Cook</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>Zack D. Cook is an engineer turned storyteller living in Lakeland, Florida with his wife, Jennifer, and their cat, Chemi—who supervises all of his creative work from the comfort of her favorite sunspot in the rocking chair by the window.</p>
    
    <p>Zack grew up on Florida’s Gulf Coast and graduated from the University of Florida in 2012 (B.S. Chemical Engineering, cum laude). After graduation, Zack took an enlighteningly fun detour in Buffalo, New York, before eventually returning home after realizing that family warmth beats lake-effect snow and seasonal depression every time. Zack now provides industrial engineering expertise to support Publix’s manufacturing plants across the country run harder, better, faster, stronger.</p>
    
    <p>Outside the spreadsheets, Zack writes stories that merge his engineering mind with his creative heart—tales of the strange beauty hiding between chaos and order. His influences span from everything Brandon Sanderson to the far reaches of Star Wars, from Fullmetal Alchemist to Evangelion—and, of course, who would he be without Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter?</p>
    
    <p>When he’s not writing, working, or spending time with his family, Zack’s usually bird-watching, shiny-hunting in Pokémon, or trying out a brand-new hobby he swears will be “the one this time.”</p>
    
    <p>Because if there’s one thing Zack’s learned, it’s that curiosity isn’t just a phase, it’s a way of life.</p>
