    <h1>About Zack D. Cook</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Zack D. Cook</strong> is an engineer turned storyteller living in Lakeland, Florida with his wife, Jennifer, and their cat, Chemi—who supervises all creative work from her favorite sunspot in the rocking chair by the window.</p>

    <p>Zack grew up on Florida’s Gulf Coast and graduated from the University of Florida in 2012 (B.S. Chemical Engineering, <em>cum laude</em>). After graduation, he took an enlighteningly fun detour in Buffalo, New York, working for Olin Chlor-Alkali for a few years, before eventually returning home after realizing that family warmth beats lake-effect snow—and seasonal depression—every time. He now provides industrial engineering expertise to help Publix’s manufacturing plants across the country run harder, better, faster, stronger.</p>
    
    <p>Outside the spreadsheets, Zack writes stories that merge his engineering mind with his creative heart—tales of the strange beauty hiding between chaos and order. His influences span from everything Brandon Sanderson to the far reaches of <em>Star Wars</em>, from <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> to <em>Evangelion</em>—and, of course, who would he even be without <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>?</p>
    
    <p>When he’s not writing, working, or spending time with his family, Zack’s usually birdwatching, shiny-hunting some <em>Pokémon</em>, or trying out a brand-new hobby he swears will be “the one this time.”</p>
    
    <p><strong>Because if there’s one thing Zack’s learned, it’s that curiosity isn’t just a phase—it’s a way of life.</strong></p>
